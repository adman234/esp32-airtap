# AC Infinity ESP32 Mods

> **About this fork.** This is a fork of [SiloCityLabs/esp32-airtap](https://github.com/SiloCityLabs/esp32-airtap)
> by Luis Rodriguez, who designed the replacement boards, the ESPHome configs and the 3D models, and sells
> assembled boards in the [SiloCityLabs shop](https://shop.silocitylabs.com/products/esp32-module-for-ac-infinity-airtap-t4-t6).
> Everything below is his, except the [Auto Vent](Airtap-Tx/Gen-2/auto-vent/README.md) package: an ESPHome config for
> the Gen 2 Rev 2 board that decides by itself when to boost, using Home Assistant temperatures and the duct probe.
> It is derived from his Gen 2 config and shared under the same CC BY-SA 4.0 license. It is not planned to be merged upstream.

This repository contains code and instructions to modify the AC Infinity products with an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller that can be used to control the fan speed, monitor temperature and humidity, and connect to the internet. The modifications described in this repository will allow you to control your fan remotely, set up schedules, and monitor environmental conditions in your grow room or other indoor space.

 - Disassembly: Carefully open your AC Infinity vent to access the original PCB.
 - Compare PCB Layout: Match your vent’s PCB layout with the images provided to ensure compatibility with one of the three supported versions.
 - Upload Firmware: Use the provided ESPHome configuration links to upload the correct firmware version to your ESP32 module or alternative firmware compatible with ESP32-c3 module.
 - Install the ESP32 Module:
 - Replace the existing PCB with the ESP32 module.
 - Connect the PWM fans and NTC thermistor to the corresponding terminals on the new PCB.
 - (If needed) Solder the power cable to the correct pads on the PCB.
 - Secure the Module: Reassemble the vent, ensuring that all connections are secure and the module is properly seated.
 - Test Functionality: Power on the vent and check that the display is working and the device connects to your Wi-Fi network.


### How to identify your Generation

3 buttons is Gen 1, 4 buttons is Gen 2.

### Gen 1 Rev 1

This revision of Gen 1 has an aligment issue. When installed you should only use two left screws to secure the PCB. The right screws will not align with the holes. Also includes individual fan control with two PWM outputs.

[ESPHome Configuration](Airtap-Tx/Gen-1/esphome-3btn-rev1.yaml)

This includes a font that needs to be downloaded and placed in the same directory as your configuration file. You can download the font file [here](https://font.download/font/arial)

#### Pinout:

| ESP32 Pin | Function      | Xiao Pin |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| GPIO2     | PWM           | D0       |
| GPIO3     | PWM           | D1       |
| GPIO4     | Temp          | D3       |
| GPIO6     | OLED SDA      | D4       |
| GPIO7     | OLED SCL      | D5       |
| GPIO8     | Button Up     | D8       |
| GPIO9     | Button Down   | D9       |
| GPIO10    | Button Toggle | D10      |


#### Features
 - 2x PWM Output
 - 1x Temperature Sensor
 - 1x Display
 - 3x Button

### Gen 1 Rev 2

This is the second revision of Gen 1. It has the same layout with fixed hole aligment. The second PWM output was removed and both fans are controlled from a single PWM output.

### Gen 2 Rev 2: Auto Vent (this fork)

An ESPHome config for the Gen 2 Rev 2 board (XIAO ESP32-C6) that makes the vent decide for itself when to boost. It uses room temperature and thermostat setpoints from Home Assistant, the on-board duct probe, hysteresis and anti short-cycle protection, and needs no HA automations. Each vent is a short device file that pulls the shared body from this repo as a remote ESPHome package.
